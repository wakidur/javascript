	    "talk_description": "Unless you're lucky (?) enough to work with PHP only, chances there that you deal also with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the wild, PHP developers are                        supposed to know and be proficient at front-end too. For this reason, we should stay up-to-date and efficient in this field. Front-end is heavily changed in the last 2                        years due to the introduction and the growth of tools like Grunt, Bower and Yeoman. In this talk, you'll discover what they are and how they can help you to enhance your                    workflow, paying attention to highlight the similarities and the differences with their task-related PHP software.",
